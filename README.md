### Project Structure

##### Flow

For each request the flow is as follows:

1. HTTP Request for page **index.php**
2. **index.php** roots the request by parameter to the correct **view**
3. **view** does operations fetches data from **models** builds that data in a **"dictionary/variables"** to be used in **templates** and calls the proper **template**

For each test request the flow is as follows:

1. HTTP Request for page **tests.php**
2. **tests.php** includes the **all_tests.php** and shows the output

Note: Views/User actions must return vars and constant TESTING must be defined. If TESTING is defined library template_functions doesn't render html response.
